# Homework 03 - Stacks and Queues - Instructions

👉🏽 **Task**

// - Implement each of the functions to create a working stack.
// - Do not change any of the function declarations
//   - (i.e. stack_t* create_stack() should not have additional arguments)
// - You should not have any 'printf' statements in your stack functions.
//   - (You may consider using these printf statements to debug,
//      but they should be removed from your final version)
